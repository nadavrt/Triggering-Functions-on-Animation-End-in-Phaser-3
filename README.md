# Triggering Functions on Animation End in Phaser 3

## Purpose
This is a practical example that shows how to trigger functions in Phaser 3 after a specified animation ends. I created this in response to a request on YouTube, and also because I couldn't find any working POC of this anywhere.

The code is based on the [Getting Started with Phaser repository](https://github.com/nadavrt/getting-started-with-phaser) (specifically, part 5) and adds the ability for ships to be revived after they are destroyed.

## How to Use
